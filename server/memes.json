    "image_description": "This four-panel meme, known as \"For the Better, Right?\" or the \"Anakin and Padm\u00e9\" meme, originates from a scene in Star Wars: Episode II \u2013 Attack of the Clones. The format depicts a conversation where Anakin Skywalker makes a statement, and Padm\u00e9 Amidala responds with a hopeful, clarifying question, smiling. The punchline is delivered through the final two panels, where Anakin's silent, intense stare is followed by Padm\u00e9's smile vanishing, indicating a grim or unsettling truth. The meme is used to humorously contrast an optimistic expectation with a dark or disappointing reality.",

The format is used to represent an impending doom or an inevitable, often negative, consequence that is about to catch someone off guard. The humor lies in the dramatic irony of the oblivious subject being stalked by a powerful, unavoidable threat.",
